# Exam Unit 3

**First Setup (Commit #1)**

- I created a new folder named `Exam Unit 3`.
- I ran `git init` to start version control.
- I used `npm init -y` to create `package.json`.
- I installed `node-fetch` to make HTTP requests.
- Committed these changes with the message: "initialize project with npm and git".

Next steps: 
- Implement the code to call `/start` endpoint and retrieve the first puzzle.
